## New Features

* 0.10
** Support for more than one KNX interface

## Building

On Debian:

    apt-get install git-core build-essential
    git clone https://github.com/knxd/knxd.git

    # If "dpkg-buildpackage" complains about missing packages:
    # install them (with "apt-get install") and try again.
    # If it wants "x | y", try just x; install y if that doesn't work.
    # Also, if it complains about conflicting packages, remove them (duh).

    # first we need libpthsem which unfortunately isn't part of Debian
    wget https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/~mkoegler/pth/pthsem_2.0.8.tar.gz
    tar xzf pthsem_2.0.8.tar.gz
    cd pthsem-2.0.8
    dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i libpthsem*.deb

    # now build knxd
    cd knxd
    # If you're using Wheezy, edit debian/control and remove the "libsystemd-daemon-dev" line
    dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
    cd ..
    sudo dpkg -i knxd_*.deb knxd-tools_*.deb

### Daemon Configuration

Daemon configuration differs depending on whether you use systemd.
If "systemctl status" emits something reasonable, you are.

If you use systemd, the configuration file is ``/etc/knxd.conf``.
Socket activation is used for the default IP and Unix sockets
(port 4720 and /run/knxd, respectively).

Without systemd, on Debian, edit ``/etc/default/knxd``.

Old eibd clients may still use ``/tmp/eib`` to talk to knxd.
You need to either change their configuration, or add "-u /tmp/eib"
to knxd's options.
(This was the default for "-u" before version 0.11.)
